# ANTLR4 Calculator

A simple CLI calculator app.  Supports standard arithmetic operators (`()`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`) as well as sin, cos, tan, and sqrt.

There are undoubtedly _much_ more efficient ways to write a calculator app, but this was developed for the express purpose of experimenting with expression parsing in ANTLR4.
